# yolov5-dash-cam-images
# Introduction
The goal of this project was to detect four types of object (Car, Truck, Stop-Sign, Traffic-Light) in dash cam images. Technically, the underline aim of this repository is to optimizer the state of the art object detection algorithms on dash cam images. This repository uses the most accuracte architecture of yolov5x for this purpose. The discription of the data can be seen at https://aiconnect.gomotive.com/aichallenge/. 
# Training Data
The training data consists of 40,000 labled training images and 7,000 unlabled testing images.
# Preparing Data
# Training yolov5x for Dash cam Images Competition
# Testing and Validation Results
